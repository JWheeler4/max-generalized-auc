** TODOs

Does greedy AUB minimization result in global AUB minimization? or
does it depend on the order in which problems are processed?

e.g. in http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~th798/viz/2019-08-16-generalized-roc/
- For small margin sizes there is only one prediction combination that results in
  AUB=0. Do we end up at this combination by greedy minimization?
- FOr large margin sizes there are several prediction combinations that results
  in AUB=0. Do we end up at one of these?

[[file:figure-neuroblastomaProcessed-combinations.R]] makes new figure
that highlights counter-examples for the proposition (AUC=1 implies
AUB=0) and shows that there are no counter-examples for the converse.

interactive plot using loon.

[[file:figure-neuroblastomaProcessed-combinations.R]] creates the
following figure which plots auc vs aub:

Note that the min AUB=0 has AUC=1, and the points with AUC>1 have
AUB>0. Thus minimizing AUB seems like a reasonable criterion.

[[file:figure-neuroblastomaProcessed-complex.R]] creates

which shows 8 labeled neuroblastoma data sequences with two different
ROC curves / predictions. Strangely both achieve 0 errors, but the one
with predictions in the finite interval has a highly non-monotonic ROC
curve, and much smaller area inside the ROC polygon.

[[file:figure-neuroblastomaProcessed-combinations.R]] creates the
following figure which shows the auc values for all of the 2^8 unique
combinations of predicted values for 8 labeled profiles. 

[[file:figure-neuroblastomaProcessed-combinations.png]]

Each labeled
profiles has two minima: one in an infinite interval, and one in a
finite interval. The panel titles show the difference d from the
infinite interval limit to the predicted value, e.g. (-Inf, 1.2) with
d=1 results in a predicted value of 0.2. The overall pattern is that d
is relevant for AUC, in a range 0.001 to 10, but it has no effect
outside that range. Surprisingly there are AUC values greater than
zero, which happens when there are cycles. One example is highlighted
with a circle in the plot above, and the ROC curves are shown below.
