[[file:figure-neuroblastomaProcessed-complex.R]] creates
http://members.cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~thocking/figure-neuroblastomaProcessed-complex/
which shows 8 labeled neuroblastoma data sequences with two different
ROC curves / predictions. Strangely both achieve 0 errors, but the one
with predictions in the finite interval has a highly non-monotonic ROC
curve, and much smaller area inside the ROC polygon.
