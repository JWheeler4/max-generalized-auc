** TODOs

Does greedy AUM minimization result in global AUM minimization?
Conjecture, no it depends on the order in which problems are
processed -- TODO find counter-example.

e.g. in http://ml.nau.edu/viz/2019-08-16-generalized-roc/
- For small margin sizes there is only one prediction combination that results in
  AUM=0. Do we end up at this combination by greedy minimization?
- For large margin sizes there are several prediction combinations that results
  in AUM=0. Do we end up at one of these?

Some R scripts for interactive experimentation with grad desc algo for
learning linear model that minimizes AUM:
- [[file:figure-linear-model.R]] uses
  penaltyLearning::IntervalRegressionCV for initialization.
- [[file:figure-linear-model-zero-init.R]] uses zero vector for init.

R script with OneFold function that computes train/valid/test error,
can be parallelized over 198 test folds on the cluster:
- [[file:figure-linear-model-test.R]]

Initial results on two data sets (ATAC, CTCF) show that
- Train AUM decreases as a function of iterations (each iteration does
  line search so that is expected).

[[file:figure-linear-model-test-aum-train-decreases.png]]

- IntervalRegressionCV init is much more accurate (in terms of test
  AUM, AUC, errors) than zero init. Best linear model is not as
  accurate as best predictions, after running gradient descent on just
  the predicted values (without linear model).

[[file:figure-linear-model-test-compare-init.png]]

- Using early stopping regularization (select number of iterations
  with min AUM on validation set) does not decrease test AUM using
  IntervalRegressionCV initialization.

[[file:figure-linear-model-test-initial-selected.png]]

- The linear model which is best in terms of test AUM, over all
  iterations, is not much better than the initial iteration, for these
  two data sets.

- Do we see any improvement on other test folds / data sets?

interactive plot using loon.

[[file:figure-neuroblastomaProcessed-combinations.R]] creates the
following figure which plots auc vs aub:

[[file:figure-neuroblastomaProcessed-combinations-scatter.png]]

Note that the min AUM=0 has AUC=1, and the points with AUC>1 have
AUM>0. Thus minimizing AUM seems like a reasonable criterion.

[[file:figure-neuroblastomaProcessed-complex.R]] creates
http://members.cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~thocking/figure-neuroblastomaProcessed-complex/
which shows 8 labeled neuroblastoma data sequences with two different
ROC curves / predictions. Strangely both achieve 0 errors, but the one
with predictions in the finite interval has a highly non-monotonic ROC
curve, and much smaller area inside the ROC polygon.

[[file:figure-neuroblastomaProcessed-combinations.R]] creates the
following figure which shows the auc values for all of the 2^8 unique
combinations of predicted values for 8 labeled profiles. 

[[file:figure-neuroblastomaProcessed-combinations.png]]

Each labeled
profiles has two minima: one in an infinite interval, and one in a
finite interval. The panel titles show the difference d from the
infinite interval limit to the predicted value, e.g. (-Inf, 1.2) with
d=1 results in a predicted value of 0.2. The overall pattern is that d
is relevant for AUC, in a range 0.001 to 10, but it has no effect
outside that range. Surprisingly there are AUC values greater than
zero, which happens when there are cycles. One example is highlighted
with a circle in the plot above, and the ROC curves are shown below.
